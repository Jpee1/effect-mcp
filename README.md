## Getting Started

To get started with the Effect MCP Server, you need to have Docker installed on your machine. Docker allows you to run applications in isolated environments, making it easier to manage dependencies and configurations.

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of command-line interfaces.

## Usage

You can run the Effect MCP Server using Docker with the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm -i timsmart/effect-mcp
```

This command pulls the latest version of the server image and runs it in a container. The `--rm` flag ensures that the container is removed after it stops, keeping your environment clean.

## Claude Code Integration

To integrate this MCP server with Claude Code, use the following command:

```bash
claude mcp add-json effect-docs '{
  "command": "docker",
  "args": [
    "run",
    "--rm",
    "-i",
    "timsmart/effect-mcp"
  ],
  "env": {}
}' -s user
```

This command adds the MCP server as a JSON configuration in Claude Code, allowing for easy access and management of your Effect documentation.
